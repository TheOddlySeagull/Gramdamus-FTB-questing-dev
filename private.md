I am setting up an FTB quest book for my modded 1.12.2 medieval themed minecraft RP server.

Here is a prsentation of the server:
Gramdamus is a medieval semi-rp exploration and empire building server, with an economy. A player has it's own NPCs to make his empire work.
There are many ranks, that you get depending on how advanced your empire is. Theya re based on house count, NPC count, defences, and landmarks.
Gramdamus is focused on metal smithing, exploration and empire building.
Thousands of structures spawn in the world

There are 2 types of quests: Challenge and Tutorial.
Tutorial quests presents new features and explain how to use / work with them.
Challenges are usually late game, and ask for specific items to setup a buffed version of whatever the tutorial quests presented earlier.
