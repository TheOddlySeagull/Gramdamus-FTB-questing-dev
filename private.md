I am in the process of configuring an FTB quest book for my modded 1.12.2 medieval-themed Minecraft RP server.

Here's an overview of the server:
Gramdamus is a medieval semi-RP exploration and empire-building server with an economy. Each player possesses NPCs to manage their empire. Various ranks are attainable based on house count, NPC count, defenses, and landmarks. Gramdamus emphasizes metal smithing, exploration, and empire building, featuring thousands of structures scattered throughout the world.

There are two quest types: Challenge and Tutorial.
Tutorial quests introduce new features and provide guidance on their usage.
Challenges typically emerge in the late game and require specific items to set up an enhanced version of what was introduced in the tutorial quests.

For each quest, please provide a title, subtitle, and description. Suggestions for rewards are also appreciated. Rewards can varry from Reward Table, to items, XP, and coins.

Note: In challenge quests, players can earn currency (coins). The conversion rate is 10 copper = 1 bronze, 10 bronze = 1 silver, 10 silver = 1 gold, and 64 gold = 1 legendary.
The coins are valuabmle, a vanilla diamond would be worth a silver coin. Except challenges or hard quests, avoid going above 3 to 4 bronze coin reward.
